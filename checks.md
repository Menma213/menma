I noticed the game revolving around the basic missions so i had to spice them up to make them atleast a little interesting.  So! The game is a full on RPG now. It has a map, you're free to go anywhere you want on the map as long as you beat the areas Guardian. Guardians are bosses so they might be pretty tough, but its worth it. There's gonna be 9 total regions:
Land of Fire (You start here, Tier 1) Basic rewards and material drop.
The Village of Sound (Tier 2) x2 of the rewards & materials dropped.
The Country of Rain (Tier 3) x3
Land of Wind (Tier 4) x4
and so on until 
The valley of the End (Tier 9) x9

Note that these numbers might sound insane and they actually are. The brank you do in Land of Fire will give u 100 exp but the same in valley of end(different npc) will give you 900. The catch is that the Guardians between Tiers are omega broken. So do not expect yourself to easily climb to  Tier 9's.
All of the above stuff are done through these commands: /travel challenge, /travel move, /travel view, /map. 

CLANS
Clans are here! Anyone can form a clan as long as your not broke(1000 SS)

just read the description of each clan related command, they're very simple. But I'll explain a few important ones. As i mentioned before, the game now features a map. So uh clans can capture anything on the map and its theirs. If i wanted to capture Land of Fire, which if not captured by anyone is 500 POWER. My clan needs to have 500 or above power to capture this territory or im cooked. What increases power? WEAPONS!
