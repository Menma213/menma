## 🤖 AI Limitations & Development Scope

### What AI CAN Do ✅

**Environment & World Building:**
- Create basic 3D environments with Three.js/Phaser
- Generate procedural terrain (snowy plains, mountains, valleys)
- Implement weather effects (snow particles, fog, day/night cycles)
- Build simple geometric buildings and structures
- Add lighting systems (ambient, directional, point lights)
- Create skyboxes and atmospheric effects

**Game Mechanics:**
- Implement player movement (WASD, jumping, sprinting)
- Create camera systems (third-person, first-person, isometric)
- Build collision detection and physics
- Develop turn-based combat systems
- Create inventory and UI systems
- Implement minigames (rhythm games, target practice, etc.)

**Integration & Backend:**
- Set up Discord OAuth authentication
- Create REST APIs for bot-website communication
- Implement database connections (MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
- Build reward systems and progression tracking
- Create real-time multiplayer with WebSockets
- Set up Cloudflare Workers for security

**Visual Polish:**
- Apply glassmorphism and modern UI design
- Create particle effects and animations
- Implement shader effects (gradients, glows, outlines)
- Design HUD and menu systems
- Add visual feedback for interactions

### What AI CANNOT Do (Requires Human Assets) ❌

**High-Quality 3D Models:**
- ❌ Custom character models (ninjas, NPCs, bosses)
- ❌ Detailed building interiors and props
- ❌ Animated character rigs (walking, running, jutsu animations)
- ❌ Creature/summon models (Reindeer, Ice Golem, etc.)
- ❌ Weapon and item models with high detail

**Professional Textures & Materials:**
- ❌ Hand-painted textures for buildings
- ❌ PBR (Physically Based Rendering) materials
- ❌ Custom normal maps and displacement maps
- ❌ High-resolution environment textures

**Audio Assets:**
- ❌ Background music (village themes, battle music)
- ❌ Sound effects (footsteps, jutsu sounds, UI clicks)
- ❌ Voice acting or character sounds

4. Create UI/UX with modern design patterns
5. Test and verify all features work

**Phase 2 - Human Assets:**
1. Commission or purchase 3D character models
2. Acquire texture packs and materials
3. License or create music and sound effects
4. Create custom artwork and icons
5. Replace placeholders with professional assets

**Phase 3 - Polish:**
1. Fine-tune animations and transitions
2. Optimize performance
3. Add advanced visual effects
4. Conduct user testing
5. Deploy to production
