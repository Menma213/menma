take a look at website folder: C:\Users\HI\Desktop\menma\website
what we need to do is make this entire folder an actual fully working industry grade website. Right now its a simple single page static website, we need to make it more dynamic and interactive. And then we need to add actual css and html to the entire file. RN it runs on photos from the story mode. We need to make it run on actual html and css and js.  Make sure there's buttons for every single thing and its mapped properly. ANd for the theme of the website, go with amoled black. 
Then we need to focus on the main part of this rework
"Pixel Dungeon"
we need to integrate this free open source game from github and integrate it into the website. First of all we need to integrate it and make sure its running after that we can edit it as we want but first gotta make sure it even runs. 
also to the website add a opening animation that is a handwriting animation(code it through js or html) i already have the svg file we just need to do the handwriting animation C:\Users\HI\Desktop\menma\openinganimation.svg
and there's also a bg music that plays at 30% at all times C:\Users\HI\Desktop\menma\bgmusicstatic.mp3
