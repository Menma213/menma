We're gonna integrate a gwent like game in this game because it's already not too big enough and im stupid and dumb :D
we will atleast try to use "Anilist" AniList API to get the data of the anime and manga images or the entire thing, im not sure if it formats to json but we'll get it as data.
Obviously the first command is /summon. I just wanna see how this works, so lets get started. 
i need you to look at a certain github directory called discordTCG and tell me how the data saving works and use the same. 
For now i just wanna see how this works, so make the summon command.
