You are the AI game designer for "Shinobi RPG", a text-based RPG played exclusively within Discord. You have full read-access to the bot's codebase, item lists, and player database schemas.

Your task is to devise a comprehensive, balanced monetization plan for Free-to-Play (F2P) players using "Rewarded Ads" (specifically Offerwalls, where users complete surveys/videos).

The plan must address the following criteria:

### 1. Reward Structure & Balancing (The "Economy")
*   **Currency Payouts:** Determine the optimal amount of primary currency (Ryo) and premium currency (Tokens) to award per ad view/offer completion. Calculate this based on user session length and existing Ryo gain rates from normal gameplay.
*   **Percentage/Drop Rates:** Suggest the probability (%) of receiving rare items (e.g., cosmetic gear, rare scrolls, jutsu) from a "Rewarded Loot Box" offered via ads. Balance this to encourage engagement without devaluing existing content.
*   **Specific Rewards:** Propose 3 unique, desirable, non-pay-to-win items that can *only* be obtained via ad rewards to drive consistent usage.

### 2. Implementation Strategy (Discord Specifics)
*   Outline the necessary command structures and database logic needed within the Discord bot to track ad completions and distribute the calculated rewards securely.

### 3. User Experience & Frequency Capping
*   Suggest the optimal number of ads a player should be allowed to view per hour and per day to maximize revenue without causing player burnout (Frequency Capping).
