lets make a plan! if you look inside combinedcommands.js u can find the entire battle engine in one piece. And if you look at the entire directory, there's no form of multiplay- [x] Debug SRank Haku Battle

ed thing but eventually we will need to connect it to the main engine while still maintaining the exact features, let me know if thats even possible. ANd if you have a better idea. Then we can go back to our original plan of adding multiplayer environments. So yes, games are better with friends. We need multiplayer. We'll directly edit the battleengine (runbattle) inside combinedcommands.js to support 'global' multiplayer, my plan is to add support for multiplayer upto 2 (one the person who started the mission and another who is invited) my vision on this is to make changes to generatebattle image to add support for 2 players (adjusting the player pictures above eachother) and for the hp bar logic they have one single bar called "combined hp bar" this isnt displayed in the image(the text, onlt the bar is displayed) then for the battle summary, its the same, just that both players actions are shown and for hp its displayed as 'combined hp bar' and for the logic of how this multiplayer happens, we'll create a command called /multiplayer. The only job of this multiplayer command which works like /multiplayer <user> is it invites the user to a battle using an embed "<user> has invited you to a <missionname> battle do you accept their invite?> it must also ping the invited user. Note: this command should only work if the user is inside a battle, idk how we storing this but yh. lets say i start a brank and use this feature to call my friend, what happens is that it triggers a special event and a new embed appears <user who started the mission> has summoned their allies! now they fight together! then the battle breaks and a fresh moves embed and a battleimage is sent. The flow goes somewhatt like this /brank /mutliplayer @thunder2 *when i run brank normally it would send the moves embed and the battle image waiting for me to make my move* now when i used my multiplayer command, a fresh moves embed is sent and a battle image which now contains both our profile pictures against the npc. 2 players means 2 moves embeds, the first one is sent with the battle image and now it waits for player to make a move, if done, ONLY then it should send the player 2's move embed or else we'll crash discord. Okay, that being said that's the entire multiplayer process. We just need to get our base right, by detection of player missions and allat. There's alot of files in this directory that use runbattle, if we have access to them all(i mean if we know that those are) we can easily add trackers. That's it for the multiplayer side for now, add suggestions for everything. THen we come to the backend of the bot, the times. So we have 4gb of ram out of which we use about 86mb whenever bot is fully loaded, and we have about 150% cpu usage limit and when players use the bot it max goes as high as 0,8. Which means we're not using anything at all and we need to allocate and use our resources properly to minimize response times after all, i am indeed playing for all these resources. Errors wise, people have reported the bloodline shrine mechanism stopping at 5, i mean the timnes they pray at a shrine caps at 5 for some reason. Now coming to the miscs maybe not miscs even this is very important: if you look inside website directory u can see a full on website that actually communicates with the bot. And since we have discord logins, we can actually display users stats we need to make a home page and add some of the informational features. We need to fill up the website part with everything so it looks stuffy and tbh we have wayy more content than we'll ever need to stuff the website. But we need to use the website for a specific purpose though, we need to make like a database for the jutsu information. Along with a suitable image of that jutsu from google, we need to do that to every jutsu in #jutsus.json thatt isnt a  custom or a npc jutsu. Then we need to do something revoltionary: we need to integrate full on game into the domain: pixel dungeon ofc we need to do alot of changes to this, but id like to start with just integration first, rn the website is a static single file website, we need to change that and switch to commerical mode. 
Okay let's plan this out first and i noticed ai's leaving most of my chuncks of text out because they call it refining, id like you to include every single feature, in detailed as i mentioned and dont forget the suggestions. GO ALL OUT, use everything ur allowed to even google search.



prompt2:
but yeah, make the website very interactive and a centralized theme that acts like the brand. as for the shrine, its inside the bloodline.js oh yeah i did say we were gonna integrate the pixel game too, yes do that as well. Ive reviewed everything now make sure everythgin is done right, i dont see why u didnt check or touch srank though.
